            <p>Trinity is owened and managed by Trinity .ln.Pvt.ltd, My parents started The Travel Agent in 1979. My father had just taken early retirement, the nest was empty, and they were both ready for their next adventure.  She had experience in the industry from her work at an agency downtown; he had great business acumen. It was a perfect fit. Carmel, Indiana was an up and coming city at that time. As the city grew, so did the agency.They were handling leisure travel for a lot of Carmel residents, many of whom were business owners or managers. Pleased with the agency, many of those clients requested The Travel Agent see to their corporate travel needs as well. We added on personnel and so forth; the agency continued to grow.</p>
